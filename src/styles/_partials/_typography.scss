  // Thank you -- I will need to look up how to convert these myself and also I need to ask you why you added that swap for display. I dont know what it means, I will Google fu this of course. But in the event I am like a lost puppy.. (insert Inspector Clouseau voice) I'ma just ask.

  // Lmao. font-display basically tells the browser to 'swap' the font here for a fallback if it cannot find the actual font, or there's a delay in it loading the font file. It's used as a 'in the meantime.' This ensures the user can still read the content and it hasn't disappeared in that time. I'll send you a link on it and it's other values.
